## 词语剖析

### 单词剖析

- man
  - 操纵
  - `The telephones are manned 24 hours a day by volunteers.`
- necessarily
  - `This word is not necessarily positive or necessarily negative.`
    - 这个词不一定是褒义，也不一定是贬义。
- purpose
  - 用处，意义
  - `Volunteer works give her life purpose.`
  - `I tried to stop him from smoking, but to no purpose.`：徒劳。
- should
  1. 应该：`should`
     - `That is as it should be.`
  2. 本应该，却没发生（没做）：`should have + pp`
     - `The train should have arrived 20 minutes ago.`
     - `Yesterday should have been the start of the soccer season.`
     - 注意，`must have + pp`是指现在对过去可能发生的事情进行的推测。
       - `Jane should have arrived now; she must have missed the bus.`
  3. 有必要（英国）：`should`
     - `It is essential that you should be present.`
     - `Is it necessary that my uncle should be informed?`
     - 在美国，`should`通常去掉。因此`should`其实没有任何意思（主句已经表达了必要之意），只是一种强调方式。
     - 类似地，主句出现`decide/insist/suggest/propose/demand/request/desire/order/important`之类，that从句都可以这么操作。
  4. 在虚拟语气（subjunctive mood）中，表达事实或看法：`should`
     - `I regret that he should be stubborn.`：我很遗憾他竟然如此固执。
     - `I was regret that she shouldn't have invited Stephen.`：她竟然没有邀请Stephen，我很惊愕。
     - `I'm sorry you should think I did it on purpose.`：你居然以为我是故意的，我很遗憾。
  5. 在if从句中表示发生概率小：`if sb should do...`
     - `If you should run into Peter, tell him he owes me a letter.`：如果你撞见Peter，告诉他，他欠我一封信。
     - 通常换一种写法：去掉if，主语放前面。
       - `Should you have an accident, synthetic quilts are quite easy to wash.`：万一尿床，化纤被子很好洗。
       - `Tortoises are able to withdraw their head should danger threaten.`：乌龟一遇到危险，能把头缩回去。
- treat
  - 招待，款待：名词或动词
  - `Don't worry about the cost—I'll treat you.`
  - `It's my treat.`
    - 我请客。
- upfront
  - in advance
  - `We should be very clear about that upfront.`
